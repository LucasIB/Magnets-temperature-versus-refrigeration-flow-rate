# Magnets-temperature-versus-refrigeration-flow-rate

> Analysis of the accelerator magnets temperature and the relation with the water flow rate.

- Main topics analysed:
  - Temperature analysis of the sextupole magnet with certain flows:
  - 1.0 L/min
  - 1.5 L/min
  - 2.0 L/min

- Predicting temperature results (outputs) for some inputs data, as:
  - Integrated Magnet field (T.m)
  - Roll angle (rad)
  - Displacement of the center magnet (X-axis, Y-axis - urad)
